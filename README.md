# Heart Disease Prediction

Throughout history, many diseases have caused lots of suffering and death. Nowadays, heart disease is a major concern for our health. Factors like smoking, overeating, and lack of exercise can make it even worse. Heart disease can be tricky because it often occurs without warning signs. That's why it's crucial to find ways to detect it early, using basic information and symptoms.

I used ensemble learning to analyze some data and discovered some interesting results. I tried different methods, including CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU, and applied various data analysis and visualization workflows to explore and communicate insights from the data.

I referred to two papers that I thought might help me:

1. [Diagnostics Journal Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/12/3215)
2. [The Cryosphere Journal Paper](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/1447/2022/tc-16-1447-2022.pdf)

I obtained the dataset from Kaggle:
